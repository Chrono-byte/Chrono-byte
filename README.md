### Hi I'm Chrono.

I am a software developer and freshman at IUPUI. Currently, I am developing a real-time chat application from scratch using Node.js and WebSockets. With 7 years of programming expertise, I possess a wide range of skills including C++, JavaScript, and some light TypeScript and Python knowledge. I competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for 4 years as a programmer and designer. With a diverse range of interests, I aspire to work in the motorsport industry.

- 🤖 4 years of experience competing as a team programmer and designer in the [VEX Robotics Competition](https://robotevents.com/teams/view/7701F).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, you can email, or DM me on Discord at `@chrono__`. I'm always open to talking about almost anything.
