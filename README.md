Hello! I'm a software developer and computer science student at Indiana University Indianapolis. I enjoy building creative and meaningful projects with code. My favorite languages include TypeScript, C++, and Rust, which I use to turn ideas into reality. When I'm not coding, I participate and manage the Overwatch eSports program at IUI, for which I built a custom scheduling platform to help keep everything organized.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
