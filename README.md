I'm a self-taught software developer and have worked on a variety of different projects that interested me. I have used Linux-based computers for 5 years. I have been doing computer programming for 8 years and have experience with TypeScript, C++. I've worked on a few websites and Discord chat bots as well as several hobby chat servers. During my time in high school, I competed in the VEX Robotics Competition as a programmer and designer for my team.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
