### Hi I'm Chrono.

I am a software developer and engineering student, and I am preparing to take on my freshman year at IUPUI. Currently, I am developing a real-time chat application from scratch using Node.js and WebSockets. With 7 years of programming expertise, I possess a wide range of skills including C++, JavaScript, and some light TypeScript and Python knowledge. Moreover, I have competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for 4 years as a programmer and designer. My team worked hard in the Indiana region and qualified for the State Championship in 2023, barely missing out on the World Championship. With diverse interests, I aspire to work in the motorsport industry, specifically in stage rally or open-wheel racing.

- 🤖 4 years of experience competing in the [VEX Robotics Competition](https://robotevents.com/teams/view/7701F) as a team programmer and designer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
