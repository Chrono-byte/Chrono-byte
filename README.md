I'm a Computer Science student. I have worked on a variety of different projects that interested me. I have been using Linux-based computers for 6 years. I have been doing computer programming for 9 years and have experience with TypeScript and C++. I've worked on a few websites and Discord chat bots as well as several hobby chat apps.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
