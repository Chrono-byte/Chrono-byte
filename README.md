### Hi I'm Chrono.

Hi I'm Michael. I am a student at Indiana University Indianapolis.

I'm a self-taught software developer and have worked on a variety of different projects that interested me. I have used Linux-based computers for 5 years. I have been doing computer programming for 8 years and have experience with TypeScript, C++. I've worked on a few websites and Discord chat bots as well as several hobby chat servers.

- 🤖 4 years of experience competing as a team programmer and designer in the [VEX Robotics Competition](https://robotevents.com/teams/view/7701F).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs and WebSockets to build a real-time chat application from scratch.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, you can email, or DM me on Discord at `@chrono__`.
