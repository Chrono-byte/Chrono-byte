### Hi I'm Chrono

I'm a software developer / engineering student and a incoming freshman at Purdue University in Indianapolis. I'm currently working on a real-time chat application from scratch using Node.js, and WebSockets. I competed in the VEX Robotics Competition for 4 years as a programmer and designer. My team worked hard in the incredibly difficult Indiana region and managed to qualify for the State Championship in 2023 and fell just short of qualifying for the World Championship. I've been programming for 7 years and have experience with C++, JavaScript, as well as some light TypeScript and Python knowledge. I'm planning to eventually work in the field of motorsports as I've had a multi-year obsession with stage rally and Formula 1. My dream is to work for a Formula 1 team as a software engineer or possibly switching disciplines and becoming a engineer.
